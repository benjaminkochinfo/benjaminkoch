# CIA World Factbook 2020 edition

The CIA took down their World Factbook [on February 4th 2026](https://www.cia.gov/stories/story/spotlighting-the-world-factbook-as-we-bid-a-fond-farewell/) for unspecified reasons.

The Factbook has always been published in the public domain. They used to offer zip archives of previous years at URLs like this one (now a redirect to the shutdown notice):

`https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/about/archives/download/factbook-2020.zip`

The 2020 edition was the last one made available as a zip file. I recovered that zip file from the Internet Archive and used it to populate this GitHub repository.

The repository is served via GitHub Pages here:
